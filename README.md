# StringCalculator
Java Program to Calculate a simple BODMAS Mathematical expression
Since class 9th when I got introduced to java, I wanted to write this program. But I eventually forgot about it, untill recently when somehow it came back into my mind while studying in college. So, one day, I sat in the digital library of my college and in about 2 hours, it was working properly for DMAS expressions. Next day, I added feature for "()" brackets as well and it tooks hell lot of error resolving and testing to get it right. But it felt awesome as it was one of my dream programs to make.
